# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @toktam/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@toktam/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual(a1, a2)`: takes in two arrays and console.log an appropriate message to the console.
* `assertEqual(actual, expected)`: the function compares the two values it takes in and print out a message telling us if they match or not.
* `eqObjects(object1, object2)`: takes in two objects and returns true or false, based on a perfect match.
* `assertObjectsEqual(object1, object2)`: takes in two objects and helps us easily test functions that return objects.
* `countLetters()`:
* `countOnly()`:
* `eqArrays()`: takes two arrays and checks if they are the same.
* `eqObjects()`:
* `findKey()`:
* `findKeyByValue()`:
* `head()`:
* `letterPositions()`:
* `map()`:
* `middle()`:
* `tail()`:
* `takeUntil()`:
* `without()`:
